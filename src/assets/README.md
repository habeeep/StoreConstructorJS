Place your customization images here:
- themes/      (png files for theme previews)
- fonts/       (png files for font previews)
- backgrounds/ (png files for background previews)

Filenames convention: images are looked up by the item's `title` after being "slugified".
Use lowercase, replace spaces with `-`, remove special chars. Example: item with title
"Light Blue" -> `light-blue.png`. For Cyrillic letters they are preserved but cleaned.

Example paths used by components: `/assets/themes/<slugified-title>.png`
